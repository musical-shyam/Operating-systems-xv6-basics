Steps
1. I first stored the process Id of the child in variable pid
2. I then checked using if, whether the fork was invoked succesfully
3. I then printed the time stamp to indicate the start of the child process
4. if the pid == 0, it is the child and i use execvp to run the command
5. if the command does not exist, then print that command does not exist and exit the process
6. if the pid > 1, it is the parent, i will use wait() to wait till the child process completes
7. i will then print the parent id and child id using getpid() and getppid()
8. once the child process is over will print the time stamp to indicate the end of the child process
9. finally use timeval_subtract(&diff, &end, &start); to calculate the run time
10. then print the run time of process.
